<p>Climate Change:
Change Your Habits First


Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be a part of a heinous transgression, a transgression so colossal that it’s radial throughout the globe? A transgression remarkably fatal that it is slowly exterminating our ecosystem one step at a time. First, raiding the atmosphere, then our ecosystems including the quintessentials of life, which will consequently end humanity. Yes, humanity, you and I, along with the other 7.6 billion individuals on this very Earth. Well then, envision no more! You already are a part of this transgression; as a matter of fact, we all are. Now, would you like to know what this so called “ Heinous Transgression ” is? It is Climate change. The steps that it takes to extinct our Earth come from our very own bodies, our feet to be exact. Okay, okay, not literally but it is called a “ Carbon Footprint ”. 

Now that I have introduced a new concept, you probably want to know what a  “ Carbon Footprint ” is, so here is a little synopsis; Carbon Footprints are essentially the overall volume of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by human activities, generally expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2). These “ Footprints ” are calculated annually. To give you a better understanding as to what a Carbon Footprint is, take a look around you, wherever you may be, there are various examples of your Carbon Footprint. For instance, those lights that are keeping you out of darkness, lights use electricity and the generation of electric power produces a huge chunk of CO2. What about that heater that keeps you warm throughout Winter? Oil, gas and coal are all linked with the production of Carbon Dioxide as well. Even the car or bus you took to school this morning, it’s engine burns fuel. All of these examples are pollutants that contribute CO2 to our atmosphere and in the long run assists in broadening Climate Change.

If you thought those tiny habits we do on a daily basis were a great deal of pollution, you thought wrong. Aside from the hundreds of thousands of other methods that we create Carbon Dioxide with, these are only a few ways we harm our planet. On a greater scale, imagine the entire world contributing to Climate Change by creating pollution. Did you know, the number of cars in this world surpasses ONE BILLION? Did you know there are roughly TEN MILLION factories around the world? Did you know the world’s population consumes FIFTEEN TERAWATTS of power from a variety of energy sources that spawn our power, such as: oil, coal, natural gas and substitutes for instance: solar power, wind, hydropower and biofuels? Can you even perceive how much power 15 terawatts is? For comparison, most lightbulbs in our homes deplete 100 watts of energy. One terawatt could comparatively power TEN BILLION 100-watt light bulbs simultaneously. Now add all those CO2 sources together and multiply them by how many days there are in a year, so that you can imagine how much Carbon Dioxide we really produce. Yeah, it’s difficult for your little mind to comprehend. Have you ever wondered what treacherous consequences our atrocious habits will have on: The Earth, humanity, and animals? Of course you haven’t! Because we all like to think that our actions won't have an impact on our planet or all these
 “ insignificant ” actions won't add up in the long run. Alas, this is the reality of  how vast our Carbon Footprints really are. 

We never listen to those Public Service Announcements (PSAs) or posters that tell us to stop our habits that aids in flourishing Climate change. Why is that the case? On account of PSAs  not going into details or thoroughly explaining the topic, it causes you to conceive that it is not a crucial issue or that you altering an aspect of your harmful habit will not make a significant difference; as a result, you disregard that message, in one ear and out the other it goes.

	Consequently, each day the Earth gets a little warmer, but we do not realize it. During the past century, the Earth’s temperature has risen by more than a degree. This does not seem that serious, but it is affecting the planet’s climate absurdly: Polar ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, droughts are occurring more often, wildfires are becoming more common, coral reefs are dying, global agriculture supplies are declining, and lastly deforestation is thriving. Some zones of the globe will experience extreme heat while others will become cooler. In result of: flooding, drought and intense summer heat or: violent storms and other extreme weather events

	One of the most crucial impacts of Climate Change is the effect it will have on our global water resources.Water resources are really important to us humans and surrounding ecosystems. Water is a quintessential in all forms of life, be it: Humans, insects, fish, animals or agriculture. Without a sustainable source of water, humanity will enter extinction along with other forms of life. 

If we lost our oceans and aquatic life disappeared (due to effects of climate change) it would result in severe changes across the globe. Marine life solely balances the ocean: it keeps pollution under control  and refines toxins from the water as well. The deficit of this major food source (for those who are unable to afford chicken or red meat -- the lower class in third world countries)  will cause epidemic misery and mishap all over the world. This would augment poverty, malnutrition, and in result, starvation.     A world without fish is hopeless. With the deprivation of fish: “ Life as we know it, will cease to exist ” , since the ocean won't be capable of operating its fundamental functions, inducing a lower quality of life. Humans will famish if they lose one of their main food sources. We depend on a reliable, clean supply of drinking water to sustain our health. Correspondingly, we require water for agriculture, energy production, navigation, recreation, and manufacturing. All these uses put pressure on water resources, causing them to slowly deplete. After we have lost our water resources, humans will be unable to grow crops, vegetation or plants. Now you may think, “ Oh it’s alright, we still have animals to eat. Right? ” Wrong! Unfortunately, animals need both water and agriculture to feed off of,  there goes the animals too! Destitute of: H20, vegetation and animals, humans have absolutely no chance of surviving and that is the end of life as we know it.

Can you believe that could be our future all because of the carelessness of our actions? If each and everyone of us do not act now and change our destructive actions, their will be no better future, let alone any future at all. Be it an elementary student changing their daily routine and walking instead of taking a bus or a whole industrial factory altering their power sources from using coal to solar power; it is the little things we do that have an affect on us and that is why it is the little habits of ours that we need to change to see a difference in our environment and future. For instance, imagine only 1 country of our world decides to place a law, a law which requires every person to use only natural sources of power such as: solar, hydro or wind power. This law would create such a dramatic difference in that country: improvement of air quality, greater atmosphere, electric cars, no water pollution, better quality of life and ultimately little or no CO2 at all. This would be the only country that actually took a significant stance into combating climate change and as result, other countries would find out about this dynamic law and would decide to do the equivalent. Gradually, country by country, they would all progress by embracing this law and soon the entire world would be practicing the same custom. This custom would be eminently beneficial towards our planet and future but would only work if each individual accustomed to this change. Well wouldn’t this be the solution to Climate Change? I mean it could be, but this was only a tiny idea and an example of how the little things add up in the long run and can make a drastic change, good or bad. 

In denouement, we need to actually do something about this radial transgression, because it will eventually affect all of us. So take the time to make an adjustment to your daily routines, little or great, it all matters and we will all benefit. Think about it, if you make this slight adjustment, is it gonna harm you? Is it a loss? No, it’s just a little more effort, so stop procrastinating and act now to live an improved lifestyle and better future.
